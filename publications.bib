	abstract = {The uncertainty in the photometric redshift estimation is one of the major systematics in weak-lensing cosmology. The self-calibration method is able to reduce this systematics without assuming strong priors. We improve the recently proposed self-calibration algorithm to enhance the stability and robustness with the noisy measurement. The improved algorithm is tested on the power spectra measured from the simulated catalogues constructed according to DECaLS DR8 photometric catalogue. For the fiducial analysis with five equal-width redshift bins over 0 &lt; $z$ &lt; 1 and six bands over scales 100 ≤ ℓ &lt; 1000, we find that the improved algorithm successfully reconstructs the scatter rates and the auto power spectrum in true redshift bins at the level of ~0.015 and $\sim 4.4  \ \rm per\ cent  $, respectively. The bias of the mean redshift is reduced by more than 50 per cent compared to the photo-$z$ without self-calibration, especially for the cases with catastrophic photo-$z$ errors. The reconstructed results of DECaLS DR8 galaxy sample are in line with the expectations from the simulation validation. The self-calibration code is publicly available at https://github.com/PengHui-hub/FP-NMF.},

	abstract = {Interloper contamination due to line misidentification is an important issue in the future low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We realize that the algorithm previously used for photometric redshift self-calibration, with minor modifications, can be particularly applicable to calibrate the interloper bias. In order to explore the robustness of the modified self-calibration algorithm, we construct the mock catalogues based on China Space Station Telescope (CSST), taking two main target emission lines, Hα and [O III]. The self-calibration algorithm is tested in cases with different interloper fractions at 1 per cent, 5 per cent, and 10 per cent. We find that the interloper fraction and mean redshift in each redshift bin can be successfully reconstructed at the level of ~ 0.002 and ~ 0.001(1 + z), respectively. We also find the impact of the cosmic magnification can be significant, which is usually ignored in previous works, and therefore propose a convenient and efficient method to eliminate it. Using the elimination method, we show that the calibration accuracy can be effectively recovered with slightly larger uncertainty.},

@article{Peng:2024aa,
	abstract = {The accurate determination of the true redshift distributions in tomographic bins is critical for cosmological constraints from photometric surveys. The proposed redshift self-calibration method, which utilizes the photometric galaxy clustering alone, is highly convenient and avoids the challenges from incomplete or unrepresentative spectroscopic samples in external calibration. However, the imperfection of the theoretical approximation on broad bins as well as the flaw of the algorithm in previous work [1] risk the accuracy and application of the method. In this paper, we propose the improved self-calibration algorithm that incorporates novel update rules, which effectively accounts for heteroskedastic weights and noisy data with negative values. The improved algorithm greatly expands the application range of self-calibration method and accurately reconstructs the redshift distributions for various mock data. Using the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we find that the reconstructed results are comparable to the state-of-the-art external calibration. This suggests the exciting prospect of using photometric galaxy clustering to reconstruct redshift distributions in the cosmological analysis of survey data.},

@article{Peng:2025aa,
	abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs), millisecond-duration radio transient events, possess the potential to serve as excellent cosmological probes. The FRB redshift distribution contains information about the FRB sources, providing key constraints on the types of engines. However, it is quite challenging to obtain the FRB redshifts due to the poor localization and the faintness of the host galaxies. This reality severely restricts the application prospects and study of the physical origins of FRBs. We propose that the clustering of observed FRBs can be an effective approach to address this issue without needing to accurately model dispersion measure (DM) contributions from the host galaxy and the immediate environment of the source. Using the clustering of 5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> simulated FRBs from future observations with sensitivity similar to the second phase of the Square Kilometre Array, we show that in extragalactic DM space, the redshift distributions can be accurately reconstructed, and the mean redshift for FRBs between 384.8 and 1450.3 pc cm<SUP>‑3</SUP> can be constrained to ∼0.001 $\pm$ 0.003(1 + z). The results demonstrate the potential of FRB clustering to constrain redshift distributions and provide valuable insights into FRB source models and cosmological applications.},

	abstract = {Calibrating the redshift distributions of photometric galaxy samples is essential in weak lensing studies. The self-calibration method combines angular auto- and cross-correlations between galaxies in multiple photometric redshift (photo-z) bins to reconstruct the scattering rates matrix between redshift bins. In this paper, we test a recently proposed self-calibration algorithm using the DECaLS Data Release 9 and investigate to what extent the scattering rates are determined. We first mitigate the spurious angular correlations due to imaging systematics by a machine learning based method. We then improve the algorithm for χ<SUP>2</SUP> minimization and error estimation. Finally, we solve for the scattering matrices, carry out a series of consistency tests, and find reasonable agreements: (1) finer photo-z bins return a high-resolution scattering matrix, and it is broadly consistent with the low-resolution matrix from wider bins; (2) the scattering matrix from the Northern Galactic Cap is almost identical to that from Southern Galactic Cap; (3) the scattering matrices are in reasonable agreement with those constructed from the power spectrum and the weighted spectroscopic subsample. We also evaluate the impact of cosmic magnification. Although it changes little the diagonal elements of the scattering matrix, it affects the off-diagonals significantly. The scattering matrix also shows some dependence on scale cut of input correlations, which may be related to a known numerical degeneracy between certain scattering pairs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the self-calibration method in real data and provides a practical alternative to calibrate the redshift distributions of photometric samples.},
