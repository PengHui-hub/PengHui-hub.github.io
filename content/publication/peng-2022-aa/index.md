abstract: The uncertainty in the photometric redshift estimation is one of the major
  systematics in weak-lensing cosmology. The self-calibration method is able to reduce
  this systematics without assuming strong priors. We improve the recently proposed
  self-calibration algorithm to enhance the stability and robustness with the noisy
  measurement. The improved algorithm is tested on the power spectra measured from
  the simulated catalogues constructed according to DECaLS DR8 photometric catalogue.
  For the fiducial analysis with five equal-width redshift bins over 0 &lt; $z$ &lt;
  1 and six bands over scales 100 ≤ ℓ &lt; 1000, we find that the improved algorithm
  successfully reconstructs the scatter rates and the auto power spectrum in true
  redshift bins at the level of ~0.015 and $∼ 4.4   m̊ per cent  $, respectively.
  The bias of the mean redshift is reduced by more than 50 per cent compared to the
  photo-$z$ without self-calibration, especially for the cases with catastrophic photo-$z$
  errors. The reconstructed results of DECaLS DR8 galaxy sample are in line with the
  expectations from the simulation validation. The self-calibration code is publicly
  available at https://github.com/PengHui-hub/FP-NMF.
