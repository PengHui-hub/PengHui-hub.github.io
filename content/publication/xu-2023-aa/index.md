abstract: 'Calibrating the redshift distributions of photometric galaxy samples is
  essential in weak lensing studies. The self-calibration method combines angular
  auto- and cross-correlations between galaxies in multiple photometric redshift (photo-z)
  bins to reconstruct the scattering rates matrix between redshift bins. In this paper,
  we test a recently proposed self-calibration algorithm using the DECaLS Data Release
  9 and investigate to what extent the scattering rates are determined. We first mitigate
  the spurious angular correlations due to imaging systematics by a machine learning
  based method. We then improve the algorithm for Ï‡<SUP>2</SUP> minimization and error
  estimation. Finally, we solve for the scattering matrices, carry out a series of
  consistency tests, and find reasonable agreements: (1) finer photo-z bins return
  a high-resolution scattering matrix, and it is broadly consistent with the low-resolution
  matrix from wider bins; (2) the scattering matrix from the Northern Galactic Cap
  is almost identical to that from Southern Galactic Cap; (3) the scattering matrices
  are in reasonable agreement with those constructed from the power spectrum and the
  weighted spectroscopic subsample. We also evaluate the impact of cosmic magnification.
  Although it changes little the diagonal elements of the scattering matrix, it affects
  the off-diagonals significantly. The scattering matrix also shows some dependence
  on scale cut of input correlations, which may be related to a known numerical degeneracy
  between certain scattering pairs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the
  self-calibration method in real data and provides a practical alternative to calibrate
  the redshift distributions of photometric samples.'
