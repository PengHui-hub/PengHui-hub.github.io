abstract: The accurate determination of the true redshift distributions in tomographic
  bins is critical for cosmological constraints from photometric surveys. The proposed
  redshift self-calibration method, which utilizes the photometric galaxy clustering
  alone, is highly convenient and avoids the challenges from incomplete or unrepresentative
  spectroscopic samples in external calibration. However, the imperfection of the
  theoretical approximation on broad bins as well as the flaw of the algorithm in
  previous work [1] risk the accuracy and application of the method. In this paper,
  we propose the improved self-calibration algorithm that incorporates novel update
  rules, which effectively accounts for heteroskedastic weights and noisy data with
  negative values. The improved algorithm greatly expands the application range of
  self-calibration method and accurately reconstructs the redshift distributions for
  various mock data. Using the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy
  Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we find that the reconstructed results are
  comparable to the state-of-the-art external calibration. This suggests the exciting
  prospect of using photometric galaxy clustering to reconstruct redshift distributions
  in the cosmological analysis of survey data.
