abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), millisecond-duration radio transient events, possess
  the potential to serve as excellent cosmological probes. The FRB redshift distribution
  contains information about the FRB sources, providing key constraints on the types
  of engines. However, it is quite challenging to obtain the FRB redshifts due to
  the poor localization and the faintness of the host galaxies. This reality severely
  restricts the application prospects and study of the physical origins of FRBs. We
  propose that the clustering of observed FRBs can be an effective approach to address
  this issue without needing to accurately model dispersion measure (DM) contributions
  from the host galaxy and the immediate environment of the source. Using the clustering
  of 5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> simulated FRBs from future observations with sensitivity similar
  to the second phase of the Square Kilometre Array, we show that in extragalactic
  DM space, the redshift distributions can be accurately reconstructed, and the mean
  redshift for FRBs between 384.8 and 1450.3 pc cm<SUP>‑3</SUP> can be constrained
  to ∼0.001 $±$ 0.003(1 + z). The results demonstrate the potential of FRB clustering
  to constrain redshift distributions and provide valuable insights into FRB source
  models and cosmological applications.
