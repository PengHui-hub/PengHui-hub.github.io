abstract: Interloper contamination due to line misidentification is an important issue
  in the future low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We realize that the algorithm
  previously used for photometric redshift self-calibration, with minor modifications,
  can be particularly applicable to calibrate the interloper bias. In order to explore
  the robustness of the modified self-calibration algorithm, we construct the mock
  catalogues based on China Space Station Telescope (CSST), taking two main target
  emission lines, HÎ± and [O III]. The self-calibration algorithm is tested in cases
  with different interloper fractions at 1 per cent, 5 per cent, and 10 per cent.
  We find that the interloper fraction and mean redshift in each redshift bin can
  be successfully reconstructed at the level of ~ 0.002 and ~ 0.001(1 + z), respectively.
  We also find the impact of the cosmic magnification can be significant, which is
  usually ignored in previous works, and therefore propose a convenient and efficient
  method to eliminate it. Using the elimination method, we show that the calibration
  accuracy can be effectively recovered with slightly larger uncertainty.
