summary: An online talk in the DESI Collaboration Meeting
abstract: 'The accurate determination of the true redshift distributions in tomographic bins is critical for cosmological constraints from photometric surveys. In this talk, I will first briefly introduce the redshift self-calibration method, which can utilize the photometric galaxy clustering alone, is highly convenient and avoids the challenges from incomplete or unrepresentative spectroscopic samples in external calibration. I will present some works on the validation and application of the self-calibration method. Then I will show the recent improvements we have made to the algorithm, which greatly expands the application range of self-calibration method and accurately reconstructs the redshift distributions for various mock data. Using the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we find that the reconstructed results are comparable to the state-of-the-art external calibration. Finally, I will discuss the combination with spec-z cross correlation to further improve the reconstruction accuracy.'
